/*
Case n = 2. 
Can we move Disk 1 and Disk 2 from Tower 1 to Tower 3? Yes. 
1. Move Disk 1 from Tower 1 to Tower 2 
2. Move Disk 2 from Tower 1 to Tower 3 
3. Move Disk 1 from Tower 2 to Tower 3 
Note how in the above steps, Tower 2 acts as a buffer, holding a disk while we move other disks to Tower 3. 
Case n = 3. 
Can we move Disk 1, 2, and 3 from Tower 1 to Tower 3? Yes. 
1. We know we can move the top two disks from one tower to another (as shown earlier), so let's assume we've already done that. But instead, let's move them to Tower 2. 
2. Move Disk 3 to Tower 3. 
3. Move Disk 1 and Disk 2 to Tower 3. We already know how to do thisâ€”we just repeat what we did in Step 1.
