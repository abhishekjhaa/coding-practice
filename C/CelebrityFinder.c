/*
For any two distinct people a and b, a may or may not know b. However, the "knows" 
relation is not symmetric, which means that a may know b, but b may not know a. 
The knows relation is anti-reflexive, i.e., a does not know a. At a party, everyone 
knows someone else. Now a celebrity joins the partyâ€”everyone knows him, but he knows no one. 

Let F be an n x n Boolean 2D array representing the "knows" relation for n people; 
F[a][b] is true if a knows b, and F[a][a] is always false. Design an O(n) algorithm to find the celebrity.

If F[i][j] is true, we know that i is not the celebrity,

allowing us to advance from F[i][j] to F[j][j + 1] since i < j.
We eliminate one candidate each step in 0(1) time which gives us a O(n) time algorithm.
